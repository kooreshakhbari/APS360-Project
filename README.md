# APS360-Project for Group 32 (Summer 2020)

Goal of the project is to have it detect ingredients and them from that look up recipes and return a list of potential recipes to the user.

We will look up recipes by using available APIs

We are training our model on a rented GCP server with a NVIDIA Tesla GPU and our training takes really long  (600s per epoch)

We are also making a web app to allow the user to go to our website, upload their photos and then get a list of potential recipes.
